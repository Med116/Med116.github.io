Dexergon64 QMK board home page

This 64 key RGB keyboard was designed by me in Kicad, because I wanted a slight ergonomic keyboard, with per key rgb, and a numpad.
I thought it was redundant that there were numpads and also a number row, so I decided to use the number row as the numpad.
It is a normal qwerty layout in an overall sense, but, there are some differences. 
The main difference is the right/left bracket keys are used as right/left paren (in the default layout), and that the plus and minus keys are moved to the right of a 2.75U spacebar. Also, there is not a caps lock key. Caps lock mode is entered into when you do fn + tab. 
RGB modes supported by default are RAINBOW, BREATHING, SNAKE, TWINKLE.

I flash the blackpills with the firmware to make this work, but you can also see the code here, and modify the keymap, and recompile on your own.
